          <p>
            To be eligible for the CryptoIndexFund native token airdrop, all you need to do is own LP (Liquidity Provider) tokens of the investment token of your choice within our platform.
          </p>
          <p className="font-semibold text-foreground">
            The more tokens you've invested (represented by your LP tokens), the bigger your airdrop allocation will be. This means greater initial ownership and subsequently, potentially bigger weekly rewards!
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground">
            Specific snapshot dates, claim processes, and further details on tokenomics will be announced soon. Stay tuned to our official channels and the countdown timer for the latest updates.
